The goal of testpackage is to …

## Installation

You can install the released version of testpackage from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("testpackage")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("katiepress/testpackage")
```

## Example

Binding two factors via `fbind()`:

``` r
library(testpackage)
## basic example code
a <- factor(c("character", "hits", "your", "eyeballs"))
b <- factor(c("but", "integer", "where it", "counts"))
```

Simply catenating two factors leads to a result that most don’t expect.

``` r
c(a, b)
#> [1] 1 3 4 2 1 3 4 2
```

The `fbind()` function glues two factors together and returns factor.

``` r
fbind(a, b)
#> [1] character hits      your      eyeballs  but       integer   where it 
#> [8] counts   
#> Levels: but character counts eyeballs hits integer where it your
```

Often we want a table of frequencies for the levels of a factor. The
base `table()` function returns an object of class `table`, which can be
inconvenient for downstream work.

``` r
set.seed(1234)
x <- factor(sample(letters[1:5], size = 100, replace = TRUE))
table(x)
#> x
#>  a  b  c  d  e 
#> 19 19 21 22 19
```

The `fcount()` function returns a frequency table as a tibble with a
column of factor levels and another of frequencies:

``` r
fcount(x)
#> # A tibble: 5 x 2
#>   f         n
#>   <fct> <int>
#> 1 d        22
#> 2 c        21
#> 3 a        19
#> 4 b        19
#> 5 e        19
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also
use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An
example workflow can be found here:
<https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
